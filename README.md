The project has a variety of art items in display. Some custom, some of free access and use.

its entirety a THREE.js project, we decided to migrate it to A-Frame to test its convenience against a stand-alone THREE.js app for VR and the results are superior. The most important part is that there's a default behavior such as controls across VR devices and compatibility that makes it easy to work with it.

# Navigation

In this version, the main navigation is hand controls (Vive wands and Oculus Touch) to fire a teleporting ray to target where you want to be at.

For desktop the traditional gaming controls are available (WASD, arrow keys and mouse).

For mobile platforms (GearVR and Cardboard) Teleport Spots with a Gaze cursor are the way to jump to the several targets placed in the hall.
